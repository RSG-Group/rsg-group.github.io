# RSG-Group's website

This website is created with ```React``` and ```CSS``` (Configuration with ```create-react-app```)

The website is styled only from me ([radi cho](https://github.com/Radi123)) with css (without other libraries and frameworks, like Bootstrap or Semantic UI). I'm going to use [`rsg-components`](https://npmjs.com/package/rsg-components) - Our own package with styled React Components.

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/RSG-Group/rsg-group.github.io
cd ./rsg-group.github.io/website
npm install or yarn install
```
After that use the commands from ```create-react-app```

### `create-react-app` commands
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`: [view here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#converting-to-a-custom-setup)
 ***
Alternatively you may use `yarn`
